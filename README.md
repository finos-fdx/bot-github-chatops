# bot-github-chatops

A [Symphony](http://www.symphony.com/) bot that uses ChatOps techniques to allow a firm employee to interact in a
compliant manner with GitHub issues and PRs in the [various FINOS GitHub organisations](https://finos.github.io/), via
CLI-esque interactions with the bot.

## Current Status

The [MVP](https://github.com/finos/bot-github-chatops/projects/1) is effectively complete, and the bot has been
deployed on a pre-production basis to the Foundation's production pod, with cross-pod enabled so that you can interact
with it from any cross-pod enabled Symphony account.

[Feedback, comments, bug reports & enhancement requests are all welcome!](https://github.com/finos/bot-github-chatops/issues)

## Installation

There is no installation required for the bot, beyond searching for it on the Symphony production network (the bot's
name is "GitHub Bot") and requesting a connection.  The bot automatically accepts all connections requests every 30
minutes, so it may take up to that long to accept your request.

If you have an account on the [Symphony public pod](https://my.symphony.com/), and have already established a connection
to the bot, you may [chat with the bot here](https://my.symphony.com/?embed/&module=im&userIds=73942156967980).

## Usage

The bot will provide you with help by asking it for `help`:
